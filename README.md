- Deploy to a production environment after successful tests
- Send notifications for deployment status to a communication channel like Slack
- Ensure code quality with linting steps
- Track test coverage with code coverage reporting
- Perform type checking with static analysis tools like `mypy`
- Speed up the workflow with caching for dependencies
- Check for security vulnerabilities in the dependencies using a tool like `safety` or `bandit`

## Deployment

## Checking Out a Pull Request
To check out a pull request using GitHub CLI, use the following command:

```sh
gh pr checkout <pr-number>
```

For more details, refer to the [GitHub CLI documentation](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr_checkout).

## GitHub Actions Workflow for Checking Out Pull Requests
We have set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the process of checking out pull requests. This workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/checkout.yml` file.

The workflow includes the following steps:
1. Install GitHub CLI
2. Authenticate GitHub CLI using a GitHub token
3. Check out the pull request using `gh pr checkout ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}`
